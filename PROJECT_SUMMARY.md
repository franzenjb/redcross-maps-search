# Red Cross Maps Search Portal - Project Summary

**Date Created**: October 25, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and Deployed

## üéØ Project Overview

Enhanced search portal providing intelligent access to 949 American Red Cross maps and disaster response resources across all 50 states and territories.

## üìç Live Deployment

- **Live Application**: https://franzenjb.github.io/redcross-maps-search/
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/franzenjb/redcross-maps-search
- **Portfolio Listing**: https://franzenjb.github.io/portfolio-showcase/

## üîß Technical Details

### Files Created
- `index.html` - Main application (7,500 lines, self-contained)
- `extract_all_redcross_resources.py` - Data extraction script
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Data Processing
- **Source**: https://maps.redcross.org/website/maps/ARC_Map_Links.html
- **Total Resources Extracted**: 949 unique resources
- **Categories**: 11 (Organization, Emergency, Demographics, Geography, Weather, Federal, Maps, Political, Land Management, GIS, Other)

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Intelligent State Search**
   - Full state names ("Florida", "Texas") ‚Üí State codes ("FL", "TX")
   - State abbreviation search (2-letter codes)
   - URL-based state detection

2. **Sidebar Navigation**
   - Accordion-style category browsers
   - Type-specific filters (Chapter Maps, Regional Maps, etc.)
   - Visual feedback with active states

3. **Professional Design**
   - Red Cross brand colors (#ED1B2E)
   - Responsive layout
   - Sticky sidebar
   - Mobile-friendly

4. **Search Capabilities**
   - Real-time filtering (300ms debounce)
   - Multi-field search (titles, categories, types, URLs)
   - Category pills for quick filtering
   - Result count display

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixed

**Problem**: Original extraction script only detected state abbreviations in URLs (`/FL/`), missing full state names (`/Florida/`)

**Impact**: Resources were tagged as "National" instead of state-specific, making them unsearchable by state name

**Solution**: Enhanced extraction script to detect both:
- State abbreviations: `/FL/`, `RCFL`, `_FL_`
- Full state names: `/Florida/`, `/NewYork/`

**Result**: "Florida" search now returns 18 results (previously 0)
